# Simple Distribution system


These interfaces form a simple, un versioned distribution system, that focuses on resource contents (bytecode) over it's location (address). It allow to construct efficient factories for creating and managing multiple instances of the same resource.

Contents:

- **CodeIndex**: Simple contract allowing anyone to register association between a bytecode and it's location on chain
- **Distribution**: Contract that allows to instantiate from same resource (bytecode)
